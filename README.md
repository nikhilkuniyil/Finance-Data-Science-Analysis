# Stock-Data-Analysis

## About
In this data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. This project is just meant to practice my visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice. The data was extracted using the YAHOO! API, and represents stock data for Bank of America, CitiGroup, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo.
